# Rmarkdown_Seminar

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rmarkdown_Seminar is to store presentation files for a seminar on R Markdown.

To run the presentation, you will need to install three packages, namely 'DiagrammeR', 'rticles', and 'xaringan':

```{r}
# install.packages("DiagrammeR")
# install.packages("rticles")
# install.packages("xaringan")
```
