# Rmarkdown\_Seminar

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of Rmarkdown\_Seminar is to store presentation files for a
seminar on R Markdown.

To run the presentation, you will need to install three packages, namely
‘DiagrammeR’, ‘rticles’, and ‘xaringan’:

``` r
# install.packages("DiagrammeR")
# install.packages("rticles")
# install.packages("xaringan")
```
